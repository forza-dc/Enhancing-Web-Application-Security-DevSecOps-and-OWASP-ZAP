# Enhancing Web Application Security: DevSecOps and OWASP ZAP
## Lab Overview

DevSecOps is an approach that integrates security practices into the DevOps process, aiming to ensure that security is an integral part of the software development lifecycle. In this case, the project involves setting up and utilizing OWASP ZAP within a Docker container for automated security scans of web applications. This aligns with the principles of DevSecOps by incorporating security measures early in the development and deployment pipeline, also known as the 'Shift Left' philosophy, allowing for proactive identification and mitigation of potential vulnerabilities earlier in the software development process.
This short project delves into the setup and utilization of OWASP ZAP within a Docker container, enabling automated security scans for web applications. From installing Docker to pulling the necessary ZAP image, running scans with customizable parameters, and interpreting the generated reports, this article provides step-by-step instructions, and insights into identifying potential vulnerabilities within web applications. Explore the importance of proactive security measures and gain practical knowledge to fortify your web app against cyber threats.
